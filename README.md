pboxify
=======

Short shell function to protobox-ify an application

# Installation

Either copy the body of the script to an executable at a PATH included location, or add the function to the end of your .bash_profile, .bash_login, or .profile files

# Usage

Just use `pboxify` in a project folder with a .protobox.yml in the root.

# pbox script

Upon completion, a script called pbox will have been generated in the folder. This is a quick proxy to vagrant commands in the protobox folder.
Usage: `./pbox up` `./pbox provision` etc...
